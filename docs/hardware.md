# Hardware Selection

Target form factor: AiM MXP class — 6" 800×480 display, unit 189.6 × 106.4 × 24.9 mm.
The prototype (`prototype/dash-alt.html`) is designed at 800×480, so the chosen panel
renders it pixel-for-pixel.

## Display + MCU (the big decision)

**Recommended: Waveshare ESP32-S3-Touch-LCD-7** (~$45–55)

| Spec | Value | vs MXP |
|---|---|---|
| Panel | 7" IPS RGB, 800×480 | Same resolution; ~1" larger diagonal |
| Board outline | ~192 × 105 mm | Nearly identical to MXP's 189.6 × 106.4 |
| MCU | ESP32-S3 (dual LX7 @ 240 MHz), 16 MB flash, 8 MB PSRAM | Plenty for LVGL at 800×480 |
| CAN | **Onboard transceiver + screw terminal** | Car bus needs zero extra hardware |
| Extras | RS485, I2C header, TF card slot, USB-C | TF card = free data logging later |

Why this one: the board *is* the dash — display, MCU, and the car-bus CAN
transceiver on one PCB the size of an MXP, so the custom electronics shrink to
power + sensors. A non-touch variant exists (we don't need touch); either works.

Alternatives considered:
- **Waveshare ESP32-S3-Touch-LCD-5** (5", 800×480, also has CAN) — MXS-sized, if the 7" won't fit the pod.
- **Elecrow CrowPanel Advance 7"** — similar class; evaluate only if Waveshare availability is a problem.
- **Discrete build** (ESP32-S3 devkit + raw RGB panel) — full GPIO freedom, but 40-pin FPC wiring and a custom PCB; not worth it unless we hit the GPIO wall (see Open items).

**Known compromise — brightness.** Hobby panels run ~400–500 nits; the MXP's
sunlight-readable panel is 700+ with an ambient light sensor. In a closed E46 with
a printed anti-glare hood this should be acceptable; the black-background Cup design
helps (only the digits emit light). If track testing proves it too dim, the escape
path is a high-brightness (850–1000 nit) 7" RGB panel swapped onto a discrete build.

```

Two CAN buses by design:
- **Car bus: listen-only.** The dash never transmits on the MS43/ABS bus — zero risk
  of disturbing the powertrain. Onboard transceiver handles it.
- **TPMS bus: separate MCP2515 SPI module** (~$5). Keeps an aftermarket transmitter
  off the engine bus entirely, and gives us a place to hang future accessories.

**CAN tap point:** the E46 OBD port does NOT expose CAN (K-line only). Tap CAN_H/CAN_L
at the instrument cluster connector or the DME harness.

## Bill of materials

Moved to the dedicated shopping list: **[BOM.md](BOM.md)** (~$195 excl. TPMS).

## Open items to verify on hardware arrival

1. **Free GPIO count** on the LCD-7 — the RGB panel consumes most pins (some IO is
   behind an I2C expander). Turn signals are planned onto ADS1115 channels for this
   reason (a 1.5 Hz 12V square wave reads fine at 10 Hz sampling). The WS2812 strip
   needs one true GPIO — confirm one is free; if not, LEDs stay on-screen only.
2. ADS1115 powered at 3.3V → scale the 0.5–4.5V sender to <3.3V with a divider
   (or power at 5V and level-shift I2C). Decide at wiring time.
3. MCP2515 modules are 5V boards — confirm 3.3V logic compatibility or fit an
   MCP2518FD module instead.
4. Panel brightness in-car — test before final enclosure.
